Java has powerful dev tools like eclipse sdk and netbrains
Java is a mature lang , therefore more stable and predictabe

IDE:-
jetbrains ,eclipse

-------------------------------------------
j2EE is a platform independent , java centeric environment for devloping, building and devloping web based enterprise application online.The j2EE platform consists of a set of services,application

Enterprise programming-
It is a method of devloping enterprise app,which help an enterprise or buisness organisation to manage various buisness activities

--------------------------------------------
Advantages of j2EE-

Platform independence
Java can provide indepentent programing model that can function evenly throughout the enterprise.

Managed Objects:
j2EE provides a managed enviroment for component.j2EE app are also container centric.

Reusablity:
Modularity

--------------------------------------------
Software application can be broken in three logical layers-

1.Presentation layers
2.Buisness Rules layers
3.Data Access layers

Client-
    Client is a computer which accepts data from user and sends request to the server for processing those data

Server-
    Server is computer which accepts the request comming fromt the client,
    processes those request and send neccesary response back to the client.Based on nature of req and res 
    client server architecture can be classified into following-

Single-Tier architecture-
    client machines are called dump teminal because there is no processing power there own, they only display what the server wants them to display
    ex-setup box provides all signal to the tv and tv shows the videos

    Advantage-
    1.It is very easy to implement
    2.Less costly

    Disadvantage-
    If somehow the server crashes architecture fails and all data lost

2-Tier architecture-
    client machines are called PC teminal as they have processing power

    Advantage-
    1.As client machines are individual PC they can share loads with server and can perform some basic checks,processes
    this makes this a bit faster as compared to single Tier.
    Disadvantage-
    If somehow the server crashes architecture fails and all data lost

3 Tier architecture-
    Server part is splited into two
    1.web server
    It is responsible for handling all the clients request and responses
    2.database server
    It is responsible for storing and manipulating the data stored in the database

    Advantage-
    1. faster and more secure
    2. Data Security as if web server fails then also we can retrieve the data from database server

    Disadvantage-
    1.costly
    2.There is still chance of data loss

N Tier architecture-
    There are several parrallel servers which are also termed as proxy servers
    connected to one another.

    Advantage-
    1.Data loss and architecture crash is almost negligible.

    Disadvantage-
    1.costly
    2.Complexity is high



Html is caller hypertext because it supports a concept called hyperlinking using which
we can switch from on webpage to another
